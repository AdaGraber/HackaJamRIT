# Flat Nodes

A minimalist style for Unreal Engine graph nodes. This plugin add a simplified visual appearance, flatter, that makes graphs clearer and more readable.



There is no impact on the performance and stability of the engine, only the visual aspect of the UI is changed : just some super tiny .png files used by Slate are replaced.



Works well on UE4 and UE5, since these files have not changed and the visual appearance of the graph nodes uses these same files.
